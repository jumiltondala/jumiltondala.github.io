      <h1>Monexa</h1>
      <p class="highlight">
        Monexa is a real P2P currency exchange project operating between Angola
        and South Africa (AOA ↔ ZAR).
      </p>
      <p>
        It was created from direct operational experience with informal
        exchanges, real clients, and real financial friction.
      </p>
    </header>

    <section>
      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Cross-border money transfers between Angola and South Africa are often
        slow, expensive, and inaccessible for many individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
        While informal exchange networks exist, they usually lack structure,
        transparency, and proper risk control, creating uncertainty for both
        sides.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How Monexa Works</h2>
      <p>
        Monexa operates as an intermediary between currency suppliers and end
        clients.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currency is sourced from trusted suppliers at negotiated rates and
        exchanged with clients using controlled margins. Each transaction is
        manually verified and tracked.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Business Model</h2>
      <p>
        Revenue is generated through the spread between buy and sell rates.
        The focus is on consistency, volume, and operational discipline rather
        than speculation.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Monexa reduces friction for individuals who rely on cross-border
        payments for daily needs, not investment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Trust, clarity, and operational control are treated as core assets of
        the system.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Current Stage</h2>
      <p>
        Monexa is currently operating manually using structured controls built
        in Google Sheets, allowing full visibility over transactions, margins,
        and cash flow.
      </p>
      <p>
        This phase validates the business logic before any automation.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Future Vision</h2>
      <p>
        The long-term vision is to evolve Monexa into a fully digital platform
        with automated workflows, compliance layers, and scalable operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Technology will be introduced progressively, without compromising
        operational clarity.
