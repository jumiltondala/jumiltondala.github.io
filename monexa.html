          Monexa is a structured P2P currency exchange built for clarity,
          control, and real-world operation.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is not designed for everyone. Monexa exists for people who already
          understand the friction of cross-border currency exchange and the
          limitations of both traditional banking and informal solutions.
        </p>
      </div>

    <!-- PROBLEM -->
    <section>
      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Cross-border exchanges between Angola and South Africa often rely on
        slow banking rails or informal trust-based networks.
      </p>
      <p>
        While informal solutions may work at small scale, they lack structure,
        traceability, and operational control — creating uncertainty and hidden
        risk.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
    <section>
      <h2>How Monexa Works</h2>
      <p>
        Monexa operates as a P2P exchange with intermediary responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currency is sourced from trusted suppliers and exchanged with end
        clients under predefined rules, margins, and verification steps.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not an open marketplace. Each transaction is manually reviewed,
        matched, and tracked, ensuring operational clarity and risk control.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- BUSINESS MODEL -->
    <section>
      <h2>Business Model</h2>
      <p>
        Revenue is generated through controlled spread margins between buy and
        sell rates.
      </p>
      <p>
        The focus is not scale at any cost, but consistency, traceability, and
        sustainable volume growth.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- WHY IT MATTERS -->
    <section>
      <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Monexa prioritizes simplicity on the user side while maintaining strict
        control behind the scenes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Complexity exists, but it is contained within the system — not pushed
        onto the user.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- CURRENT STAGE -->
    <section>
      <h2>Current Stage</h2>
      <p>
        Monexa is currently operating as an early-stage startup project with
        live P2P transactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        All operations are tracked using structured Google Sheets, allowing
        full visibility over margins, balances, and transaction history.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- FUTURE -->
    <section>
      <h2>Future Direction</h2>
      <p>
        The system is designed to evolve gradually toward automation, without
        sacrificing operational control.
      </p>
      <p>
        Technology is introduced only after processes are fully understood and
        validated in real operation.
